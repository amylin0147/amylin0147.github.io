            <li>Logic Design and Verification (<a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/courses/items/18341.html">18341</a>)
              <h6>This course is a second level logic design course, studying the techniques of designing at the register-transfer and logic levels of complex digital systems using modern modeling, simulation, synthesis, and verification tools. Topics include register-transfer level systems (i.e., finite state machines and data paths), bus and communication system interfacing (such as a simplified USB interface), discrete-event simulation, testbench organization, assertion-based verification and functional coverage. Design examples will be drawn from bus and communication interfaces, and computation systems, emphasizing how these systems are designed and how their functionality can be verified. A modern hardware description language, such as SystemVerilog, will serve as the basis for uniting these topics.</h6>

            <li>Principles of Software Construction - Objects, Design, and Concurrency (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/courses/15-214/2015-fall/">15214</a>)
              <h6>In this course, students engage with concepts related to the construction of software systems at scale, building on their understanding of the basic building blocks of data structures, algorithms, program structures, and computer structures. The course covers technical topics in four areas: (1) concepts of design for complex systems, (2) object oriented programming, (3) static and dynamic analysis for programs, and (4) concurrent and distributed software. Student assignments involve engagement with complex software such as distributed massively multi-player game systems and frameworks for graphical user interaction.</h6>
            </li>
            <li>Introduction to Computer Systems (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/">15213</a>)
              <h6>This course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.</h6>
            </li>
            <li>Principles of Imperative Computation (15122)
              <h6>This course teaches imperative programming and methods for ensuring the correctness of programs. Students learn the process and concepts needed to go from high-level descriptions of algorithms to correct imperative implementations, with specific application to basic data structures and algorithms. Much of the course will be conducted in C0, a subset of C amenable to verification, with a transition to full C near the end.</h6>
