					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hello! My name is Amy. I'm a third-year Carnegie Mellon student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. There are many labels to define me: a back-end computer programmer, an enthusiastic basketball player, a dabbler in graphic design, or a native Texas girl. I am, simply put, a culmination of the investement from myself, from those who care for me, and from He who loved me first.</p>

						<h3>Fidessa <br> <b>Quality Assurance Intern</b></h3>
						<p>New York, NY. Summer of 2015</p>
						<p>The 12-week internship program started with a crash course in the mechanics of the stock exchange and relevant financial technology being sold by Fidessa. I was assigned to the testing automation team, where I grew familiar with the manual test strategies and expanded existing automation tests to replace them. I was able to efficiently grow the analyses, execution, and evaluation of the software products being developed at Fidessa. I enhanced test automation frameworks and scripts in Visual Basic and C#/.NET. I implemented and executed automatic functional, regression, and acceptance test strategies.</p>

						<h3>Amerisource Bergen <br> <b>Business Analyst Intern</b></h3>
						<p>Frisco, TX. Summer of 2014</p>
						<p>During this 12-week internship program, I worked in the IT department helping to develop a suite of healthcare software. I participated in the Software Development Life Cycle and Agile work environment. I helped design the process to unify the software database, tested developing health care software, and created visual representations of the company vision, progress, and process. </p>

					<h2>Relevant classes</h2>
				</header>
					<ul>
						<li>Logic Design and Verification (<a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/courses/items/18341.html">18341</a>)
							<h6>This course is a second level logic design course, studying the techniques of designing at the register-transfer and logic levels of complex digital systems using modern modeling, simulation, synthesis, and verification tools. Topics include register-transfer level systems (i.e., finite state machines and data paths), bus and communication system interfacing (such as a simplified USB interface), discrete-event simulation, testbench organization, assertion-based verification and functional coverage. Design examples will be drawn from bus and communication interfaces, and computation systems, emphasizing how these systems are designed and how their functionality can be verified. A modern hardware description language, such as SystemVerilog, will serve as the basis for uniting these topics.</h6>
						</li>
						<li>Principles of Software Construction - Objects, Design, and Concurrency (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/courses/15-214/2015-fall/">15214</a>)
							<h6>In this course, students engage with concepts related to the construction of software systems at scale, building on their understanding of the basic building blocks of data structures, algorithms, program structures, and computer structures. The course covers technical topics in four areas: (1) concepts of design for complex systems, (2) object oriented programming, (3) static and dynamic analysis for programs, and (4) concurrent and distributed software. Student assignments involve engagement with complex software such as distributed massively multi-player game systems and frameworks for graphical user interaction.</h6>
						</li>
						<li>Introduction to Computer Systems (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/">15213</a>)
							<h6>This course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.</h6>
						</li>
						<li>Principles of Imperative Computation (15122)
							<h6>This course teaches imperative programming and methods for ensuring the correctness of programs. Students learn the process and concepts needed to go from high-level descriptions of algorithms to correct imperative implementations, with specific application to basic data structures and algorithms. Much of the course will be conducted in C0, a subset of C amenable to verification, with a transition to full C near the end.</h6>
